print("Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!")
print("It's possible Sanjay can distribute ", 12)
print(" cookies for each bowl.")

# Predict;
# I believe the output will be:
# Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!
# It's possible Sanjay can distribute  12
#  cookies for each bowl.

# Run;
# It ran as predicted.

# Corrected code, fix spacing around 12:
print("Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!")
print("It's possible Sanjay can distribute", 12)
print("cookies for each bowl.")

# Task B:
print("Sanjay has", 6, "bowls for", 144, "cookies.")

# Task C:
cookies = 144
bowls = 6
num = cookies/bowls
print("The number of cookies per bowl is: %d" % num)
# There is one text value and 3 number values
