# this is a code comment
name = "Leslie"
print("Hello", name)

# Prediction: I belive this code will output Hello Leslie
# Inspection: The code ran as I had predicted. Since the comma in the print command was not in the quotations, it was not printed. 
# To get a comma in the output you would need to place another comma inside the string.

name = "Furqaan"
print("Hello", name)

# Variables hold input values. The variable name in this case holds a string with my name; Furqaan.
