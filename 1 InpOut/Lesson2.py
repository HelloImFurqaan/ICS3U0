print(24)

# Predict: I think this will output the number 24.
# Inspect: The code ran exactly as I thought, since the integer 24 was entered into the print command directly.

amount = 24
print("Two dozens is: ", amount)

# The use of a variable is an improvement because it allows for better readability

amount = 7 * 4
print("forty-two is: ", amount)

# Corrected output:

print("Twenty-eight is: ", amount)

# Modify 3:
amount = 8
amount = amount + 1
print("The amount is: ", amount)
# This statement is adding + 1 to the variable amount. amount = 8, amount + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9.
# The syntax += works in the exact same way, with more simplicity.

# Modify 4:
amount = 8
amount = amount * 2
print(amount)
# This statement is multiplying the variable amount by 2. amount = 8, amount * 2 = 8 * 2 = 16.
# The syntax *= works in the exact same way, with more simplicity.
